This repo contains 3 set of client/server files.
1. Basic client server
> Just to establish connection between client terminal and server terminal.
2. Sync chat client server
> One by one client and server chat from the terminals.
3. Async chat client server
> Full duplex chat.

To run any of the set, first run the server file and then client file.

Note: 
1. Files are written in python 3.
2. IP addresses are generally of same machine, you can change it to your network machines
3. full duplex chat files are not working on Windows platform, due to platform dependency of select module.
